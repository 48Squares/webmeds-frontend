      <span className="inline-block py-2 text-sm">
        Generally, transactions are conducted smoothly on Webmeds. However there
        may be some cases where both the Buyers and Sellers may face issues. At
        Flipkart, we have a Dispute Resolution process in order to resolve
        disputes between Buyers and Sellers.

      <span className="inline-block py-2 text-sm">What is a 'dispute'?</span>
      <span className="inline-block py-2 text-sm">
        A 'Dispute' can be defined as a disagreement between a Buyer and a
        Seller in connection with a transaction on the Platform.

        How does a 'dispute' occur in the Marketplace?
      </span>
      <span className="inline-block py-2 text-sm">
        Disputes are filed as a result of a disagreement between the Buyer and
        the Seller. Disputes arise out of an issue that is raised by either
        party not being completely satisfied with the resolution of their
        complaint/issue.
      </span>
      <span className="inline-block py-2 text-sm">
        It is important that before a Buyer/Seller raises a dispute, they should
        attempt to solve the issue. Please note that whenever a Buyer raises a
        dispute, the Seller's payment for that order is put on hold immediately
        until the issue is resolved.
      </span>

        How is a 'dispute' created?

        , while the Seller can write to ss@flipkart.com, in order to raise a
        dispute. Disputes can be raised at a particular transaction level.

        What are the various types of 'disputes'?
      </span>
      <span className="inline-block py-2 text-sm">
        Following are the indicative examples of potential disputes:
